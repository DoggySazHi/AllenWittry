# Old Allen Wittry Competition Student Solutions
## What the heck is this?
So, every year, Troy High School (well, maybe except 2021) holds a programming competition with 10 prompts where small groups of students are tasked to solve them in a limited amount of time. Here are the prompts, as well as my attempts to solve each of them.
## And... why?
Because I want to. Plus, I'm part of the class of 2021 who has never made it to one of these competitions.
## Why does your code look like garbage?
Look, if it works, don't touch it. Many of my solutions involve Java 11+ syntax, including ``var``, lambdas, and other functional stuff. Plus, I'm a self-deprecating programmer so don't judge me >:[

## Current Status:
- 2010, 2011, 2019, and 2020 are done.
  - 2010 has one weird problem in the tester, specifically in ``MoreFunctionsGoneWildFinalTest``. I need to check that later.
- 2018 is in progress, 2012 is currently on hold.
- The rest of the years are untouched from the default templates.
